# exTreg-Analysis

Analysis of human CD4 T-cell data for identification and investigation of exTreg cells as well as how they differ from other CD4 T-cell subsets. exTreg cells were annotated from ADT marker data as CD4+CD16+CD56+ cells. 

Includes: 
- Python script for comparison and visualization of T-cell receptor V genes and V-J gene combinations across donors and T-cell subsets. 
- R code utilizing Destiny single-cell trajectory analysis (psuedotime)
- Differential Expression (DE) of single cell T-cell data using Seurat
- Visualization using single-cell heatmaps as well as pseudobulk heatmaps of RNA transcript and marker data
